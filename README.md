# Full-Screen-Stats

UPDATE FEB 2022: This was an abandoned project. I found something else that did the job better.

So this whole thing started as a huge first-world problem. My giant second monitor was too bright. The goal was to create something that simply blocked out everything on that screen, but it turned into display of various stats.

I've never published an application before, this might not be my first but we'll see.

I took inspiration from redditor /u/benotter's VR application, TurnSignal(https://github.com/benotter/TurnSignal). That's a great VR utility for keeping track of how far you turn in your VR space so you don't get the cable tangled around you. I thought it would be great to have an application for non-VR games that helped to keep you in the game and not concerned with things going on around you.
